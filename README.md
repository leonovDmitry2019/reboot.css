# Reboot.css

Reboot accepts that the modern front-end is based on components
and gives you one import (file) solution for starting a new project.

Reboot provides minimal reset and a few *must have* tweaks for your styles:
- resets margins
- resets font styles for headings
- resets lists
- resets tables
- resets iframes
- resets links outline and text-decoration
- set border-box
- set responsive behaviour for images and embeds and remove bottom spacing ðŸš€
- enable no-delay taps on supporting browsers
